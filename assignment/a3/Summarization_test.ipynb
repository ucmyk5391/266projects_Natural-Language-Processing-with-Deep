        "ROUGE is the metric that has been traditionally used to evaluate sumarization results.  The ROUGE metric expects a reference as input and it will evaluate a candidate against that reference.  ROUGE-1 calculates the number of words in the reference that occur in the candidate.  ROUGE-2 performs that same calculation but for bigrams in the reference. ROUGE-L calculates the longest common subsequence of reference words that occur in the candidate.\n",
