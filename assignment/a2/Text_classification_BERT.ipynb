        "[lesson 4 notebook](https://github.com/datasci-w266/2025-summer-main/blob/master/materials/lesson_notebooks/lesson_4_BERT.ipynb), in which we fine-tuned a BERT model for the IMDB movie reviews sentiment classification task. In that notebook, we used the bert-base-cased model and applied traditional fine-tuning, with a brief class exercise at the end to try unfreezing different numbers of layers. In this assignment, we'll start with that exercise, and ask you to explore unfreezing more specific layers yourself. Then you'll search for and try different pre-trained BERT-style models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook should be run on a Google Colab leveraging a GPU. By default, when you open the notebook in Colab it will try to use a GPU. Please note that you the GPU is reuqired for Section 3 but not for Sections 1 and 2.\n",
        "Since colab is providing free access to a GPU they place constraints on that access.  Therefore you might want to turn off the GPU access (Edit -> Notebook Settings) until you get to section 3.  Total runtime of the entire notebook (with solutions and a Colab GPU) should be about 1h with the majority of that time being in Section 3. If Colab tells you that you have reached your GPU limit, wait up to 24 hours and you should be able to access a GPU again.\n",
