        "[Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) was the first step towards neural image captioning.  Fundamentally it is an encoder-decoder scheme similar to what we've seen in class.  Concretely, it uses the CNN structure of an (at the time) state of the art image classification CNN as the encoder and it uses an LSTM as a decoder.  As in the generation models in class, it continues to generate text until a special \"stop\" token is emitted.  After **reading** the paper, answer the following questions:\n",

        "The [CLIP paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf)  describes a system that emits encodings that represent both images and text captions. The system learns to match a picture with its caption so the encoding for the image and the encoding for an associated caption should have a very high cosine similarity.  Systems like DALL-E use CLIP embeddings to generate images based on a text description by using the text encoding to get the image encoding and then processing the image encoding to generate the final image.  We're going to use CLIP in the opposite direction.  Namely we're going to use CLIP embeddings to classify images, that is to score a set of captions for an image based on the image's content.\n"

We want the highest probability to go to the most descriptive caption out of the four captions for the given image.  Notice here that even though both images contain zebras, one of them features a line of clearly visible cars.  The other image only has one small car off in the distance.  Note that the first image with the cars scores high for the caption of ```a photo of some zebras and cars``` because the zebras and cars are very visible.  The second image scores highest for ```a photo of zebras in a field``` but the small car is less noticed but scores above a zero."
